i want to add a blog section to my website.
it should be in the "Stuff" menu, just above the "Coding Explorations" option.

You also have to keep in mind that I already have a blog on https://nitinmurali.substack.com/archive

I want you to pull the title, description, published date, and open graph image associated with that blog, and paste it onto my website. 

When users click on a blog piece, it should open up in a tab that takes them to the substack page for that blog piece. 

The design of this page should be something that goes well with the rest of the website. 
Scan through the entire codebase to see what kind of aesthetic we are dealing with. 
When users hover over the Stuff menu, the following should happen:
1. Blog, first
2. Coding explorations, second
3. In the wild, third

You also need to make this design responsive and ensure it looks well in both desktop and mobile. Use the front-end design skills you have for the design. Think like a designer from Stripe or Linear or Notion to come up with something that's beautiful, that has these nice animations and effects, but also simple and aesthetic.
