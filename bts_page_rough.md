In the "BTS" page, I want to add a cleaner UI for it.
Right now, it's just one page, but I'll be adding more videos to it. I want the user interface to accommodate more videos and I also want to have a search bar so that users can search the title of the video. It should resemble something that users have already seen, like YouTube, Netflix, or Amazon Prime. It should feel very familiar and it should also feel very welcoming; they should be wanting to look at the video and see what's up with it. 

Help me design this page.
Here's a rough idea that I have in mind:

- On initial load, I want to show a list of all videos. Try to add the Amazon Prime or Netflix or YouTube aesthetic to it so that it feels very familiar and users want to click on it. Also keep in mind that I won't be adding a lot of videos, so you do not have to accommodate that page to hold a lot of videos. Create a lot of videos and add it in there. I can always edit the design of that page, but now just assume I'll be adding about 10 videos. 

- Next, I want you to add a simple search bar that users can enter their queries into to find a video that matches their query. The search bar should just query the title of the video. Every video will have a title that I will provide. So maybe add a field named title in the JSON so that it's easily searchable. 

- When users click on any video, it should automatically open up a full screen modal. Users will be able to view the video within that modal. However, when I say full screen, it should not cover the entire screen. There should be some offset on the top, bottom, left, and right sections, and there also needs to be a clear close icon that takes them back. Clicking on those offset places on the top button (left or right) should also dismiss that model and should take them back. Add some subtle animation in there so that it's not abrupt, and it matches the whole aesthetic look of the entire website. When users click on a video and it opens up in that modal, The video should start playing automatically. Users shouldn't have to click on the play button again because they've indicated an interest in watching. 

- Also, in the page where videos are listed, we need to show two things:
a. Title 
b. Short description 
These are things that will pique interest in the user and make them click on the video to watch it in full screen.
